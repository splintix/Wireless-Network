<p style="font-size: 28px; color: white;"> Wireless networks operate by using radio frequency technology,
  a frequency within an electromagnetic spectrum that is associated with radio wave propagation (Radio
  waves that spread very quickly).The spreading radio waves provides network connectivity in an area. A
  WIFI connection is established by using an adapter which creates a ‘Hotspot’. Standing in a WIFI hotspot
  grants you access to internet services.</p>
