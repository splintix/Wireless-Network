  <p>In everyday life us people use something called 'Technology', We can find examples of
    technology everywhere. Most people would know technology when observed, but what exactly
    is technology? <br> <br>
  Technology is the way where we apply scientific knowledge for practical purposes.
  It can include machines of all types (computers, fridges, microwaves,vehicles),techniques and
  methods. It may seem like technology is only electrical which is only modern technology.
  Tools like hammers, chisels, spears, wheels were examples of early human technology.</p>
