  area.<br>
  - Easy setup since there are no cables needed.<br>
  - Wireless networks provide robust security protection.<br>
  - Wireless networks reduce or eliminate wiring costs.<br>

     It is referred to as a WIFI network. The network is being used everywhere and is very popular as it is
     easily accessible without the need of using wires.</p>
